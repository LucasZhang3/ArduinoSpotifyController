Hardware Components:
--------------------
1. Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
2. 16x2 LCD Display (HD44780 compatible)
3. Joystick module
4. Breadboard & jumper wires
5. USB cable (for Arduino-PC communication)

LCD Wiring:
-----------
The LCD is connected using the following pin mapping:

| LCD Pin | Arduino Pin |
|---------|-------------|
| RS      | D7          |
| E       | D8          |
| D4      | D9          |
| D5      | D10         |
| D6      | D11         |
| D7      | D12         |

* Power the LCD with 5V and GND from Arduino.
* Use a 10k potentiometer (or fixed resistor) for contrast control (connected to V0 pin of LCD).

Joystick Wiring:
----------------
The joystick module should be connected as follows:

| Joystick Pin | Arduino Pin |
|--------------|-------------|
| VCC          | 5V          |
| GND          | GND         |
| VRx (X-axis) | A0          |
| SW (Button)  | D2          |

* No external pull-down resistors needed — internal pull-up is used for the button.

Serial Communication:
---------------------
- Arduino uses `Serial.begin(9600)` to communicate with the Python script running on your PC.
- Data is sent from Python to Arduino in a single string containing two 48-character lines (total 96 characters).
- Each update includes:
  - Line 1: Song Title
  - Line 2: Artist - CurrentTime / TotalTime

Power Supply:
-------------
- Arduino is powered via USB from the PC.
- All components (LCD, Joystick) are powered from Arduino’s 5V output.

Physical Layout Tips:
---------------------
- Use a breadboard for testing and prototyping.
- Consider mounting the joystick and LCD to a small panel or case for a clean final product.
- Optionally, add an enclosure with cutouts for display and joystick for portability and durability.
